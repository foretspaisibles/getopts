Short Note: This is an example of a short note.
Long Note:
 This is an example of a very long note whose contents spans over several
 lines.  It really has to be that long, so we will write here as much silly
 text as needed.
   And we also need several pragraphs of irrelevant text, but believe me,
 this has nothing to do with you, just with the example.
